# Future Improvements 2024/05/01

## Overview
This document outlines the future work planned for our project. As we continue to evolve and expand, we have identified several key areas of focus that will help us achieve our goals. 

## Upcoming Features
### Feature 1: Connect AIGC and PS Detector to Front-end website
- **Description**: Integrate the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) and Photoshop (PS) Detector tools into the front-end of the website. This will enable users to automatically analyze images for authenticity directly through the user interface.
- **Dependencies**: API endpoints to handle requests from the front-end. 
### Feature 2: Improve Image Trust Indicator Calculation
- **Description**: Enhance the algorithm used to calculate the trust indicators for each image. This update aims to incorporate more data points and improve the accuracy of authenticity assessments. 
- **Dependencies**: Advanced machine learning models and statistical analysis tools.
### Feature 3: Tagging and Keyword Management
- **Description**: Allow users to add and manage tags and keywords, improving searchability and categorization.
- **Dependencies**: Search functionality to process and filter images based on tags.
### Feature 4: Comment System
- **Description**: Implement a system for users to provide feedback on the metadata, suggesting edits or flagging inaccuracies.
- **Dependencies**: Backend database to store and manage comments and user suggestions. Front-end development for comment input and display interfaces. And user authentication system to manage permissions and secure comment entries.
### Feature 5: Enhance User Experience
- **Description**: Redesign the user interface and improve navigation to create a more intuitive and engaging user experience. This includes streamlining workflows, enhancing visual elements, and improving responsiveness.
- **Dependencies**: UX/UI design tools and professional services. And user testing and feedback to guide design improvements.
### Feature 6: Performance Optimization
- **Description**: Optimize the website's performance to handle higher traffic and more data-intensive operations. This involves refining back-end operations, enhancing server capabilities, and optimizing database queries. 
- **Dependencies**: Code refactoring and optimization services. The algorithms' performance for detecting AI-generated and manipulated images can be optimized to reduce CPU and memory overhead, decrease dependency on GPUs, and lower operational costs.
