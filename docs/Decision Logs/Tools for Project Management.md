# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: Feb 29th, 2024
- Decision Maker: All members
  
## Background 
As the project progresses into the new semester, the team continues to focus on web API development. The previous semester's experience highlighted the importance of streamlined tooling, consistent development environments, and effective task management for the small team. The established systems facilitated coordination, reduced inconsistencies, and optimized resource utilization.

## Challenges Revisited

- Maintaining Consistency: Ensuring that all team members work within consistent development environments remains crucial to prevent errors and inefficiencies.
- Effective Version Control: Continuation with a robust system to manage different code versions and facilitate collaboration is necessary to maintain project momentum.
- Efficient Task Management: As the project scales, the importance of managing tasks efficiently to avoid overloading team members becomes even more critical.

## Continued Decision Options
**Tooling for Development:**
1. Version Control System: Git remains the cornerstone for version control due to its widespread adoption and compatibility with existing tools.
2. Development Environment: The use of Visual Studio and WebStorm continues to provide the necessary features and support for web API development.
3. Testing Tools: Postman will continue to be the primary tool for testing API endpoints due to its ease of use and comprehensive testing capabilities.

## Decision Rationale 
Reasons for Continued Decision:
- Integration with Existing Tools: The seamless integration of GitHub Projects with Git and the GitHub code repository remains a significant advantage.
- Simplicity and Familiarity: The team's familiarity with GitHub Projects and its straightforward interface minimizes the learning curve and streamlines project management processes.
- Ease of Implementation: The team's existing familiarity with GitHub's Kanban system allows for straightforward continuation and minimizes setup time.
- Visibility and Transparency: The Kanban board in GitHub ensures that all team members and stakeholders have clear visibility into task progress and project status.

## Decision Outcome 
By continuing to use GitHub Projects and the GitHub Kanban workflow, the team capitalizes on existing knowledge and systems to maintain efficiency and cohesion in the development process. This decision supports the project's goals of streamlined collaboration, consistent development environments, and effective task management, all within the constraints of time and budget. The continuity in tools and processes is expected to enhance productivity and facilitate smoother transitions into the new semester's objectives.
