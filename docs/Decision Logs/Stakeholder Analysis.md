# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: March 3rd, 2024
- Decision Maker: All members

## Background
The stakeholder analysis conducted last semester identified key groups relevant to the project's success, including General Users, Photographers and Creators, Developers, Clients, Tutors, Shadow Teams, JPEG and Image-related Organizations, Educational and Training Organizations, and Creative Commons Organizations. This comprehensive analysis provided a clear understanding of the interests, influences, and interactions of each stakeholder group for the project.

## Continued Decision Options
The stakeholder analysis conducted in the previous semester will remain unchanged for the current semester, focusing on the key and closely - related stakeholders for the project.

## Rationale
- Consistency and Continuity: Maintaining the same stakeholder analysis ensures consistency and allows for a continued strategic approach in engaging and managing stakeholders based on established insights and strategies.
- Stability: There have been no significant changes in the project's scope, objectives, environment, or stakeholder landscape that would warrant a revision of the stakeholder analysis.
- Feedback and Validation: Feedback from stakeholders and the project's performance metrics indicate that the current understanding and engagement strategies are effective and well-received.

## Implications
- Engagement Strategies: Existing stakeholder engagement strategies will continue without modification, ensuring uninterrupted communication and collaboration.
- Monitoring: The project team will continue to monitor the stakeholder environment for any significant changes. Should any arise, the decision not to revise the stakeholder analysis will be reevaluated.
- Reporting: Stakeholder-related activities and feedback will continue to be reported as per the existing framework, maintaining transparency and accountability.

## Action Items
1. Continue to engage with stakeholders according to the established plans and strategies.
2. Monitor the stakeholder environment and project landscape for any significant changes that may necessitate a future review of the stakeholder analysis.
