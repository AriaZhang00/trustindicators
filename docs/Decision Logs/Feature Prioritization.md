- Decision Maker: All members
  
## Background 
To prioritize and implement features that enhance the visibility and usability of image metadata for users, aligning with the overall goal of improving credibility and user engagement on the platform.

## Decision 
Functionality Prioritization:
1. Primary Focus: Metadata-related Functionality
- Display EXIF Information: Implement the display of EXIF information prominently for each uploaded image. This includes aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and other relevant shooting parameters.
- Editing and Updating Metadata: Enable users to edit and update metadata for their uploaded images, providing a means for correcting or adding essential information.
- Metadata Validation: Develop mechanisms to validate metadata provided by users to ensure its accuracy and adherence to specific standards.
- Modification History: Create a system to record and display the history of metadata modifications, offering transparency and traceability.
- Tagging and Keyword Management: Allow users to add and manage tags and keywords, improving searchability and categorization.
- Metadata Extensibility: Design the metadata fields to be extensible, allowing for the addition of custom fields as per user or application requirements.
2. Secondary Focus: Visual Cue Design and Contextual Display
- Develop a user-friendly interface to display uploaded images along with their metadata.
- Encourage research and development of visual cues and symbolic representations that can complement the metadata by providing immediate context regarding credibility.
3. Tertiary Focus: User Feedback and Interaction System
- Implement a system for users to provide feedback on the metadata, suggesting edits or flagging inaccuracies.
- Set up a reporting feature for users to highlight images with potentially misleading or incorrect metadata.
4. Additional Considerations:
- Ensure all features are developed with user privacy and data security in mind.
- Implement knowledge sharing and copyright information display, aligned with the metadata focus.

## Decision Rationale 
- The emphasis on metadata-related functionality directly supports the project's goals of enhancing image credibility and user engagement.
- Displaying and allowing the editing of EXIF data, along with a history of changes, enhances transparency and trust in the platform.
- Validation and tagging features improve the accuracy and discoverability of images.

## Action Items
 - Finalize the metadata display format and begin interface design.
 - Develop the metadata editing and validation functionalities.
 - Create a plan for integrating visual cues with metadata display.
