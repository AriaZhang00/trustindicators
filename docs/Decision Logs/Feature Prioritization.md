# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: 25th March
- Decision Maker: Vidhu, All members
  
## Background 
We aim to redesign and implement a new set of credibility signals for images shared within our platform. The new signals are intended to provide clear and understandable indicators that help users determine the credibility of an image, addressing the nuances of camera photographs, scanned images, manipulated images, and AI-generated images.

## Decision Options 

- Option A: Simple Iconography Set - Develop a set of basic, easily recognizable icons for each image category. Icons would be designed based on universally understood imagery (e.g., a camera for authentic photos, a pencil for edits, etc.).
- Option B: Color-Coded System - Implement a colour-coded system where each type of image is represented by a specific colour along with the icon. This could help in faster recognition but might be challenging for colour-blind users.
- Option C: Detailed Symbol Set - Create a more detailed set of symbols that includes not just the type of image but also a level of trustworthiness (e.g., verified, unknown, suspicious). This approach offers more detailed information but could be more complex for users to understand.
- Option D: User-Driven Categorization - Allow users to tag and categorize images themselves, supported by a set of guidelines. This option empowers users but may lead to inconsistency and requires a robust monitoring system.

## Decision Rationale 
The decision was influenced by several factors:
1. User Experience: The symbols need to be easily understood by all users, regardless of their background.
2. Clarity and Accuracy: The credibility signals must accurately reflect the nature of the image and its level of trustworthiness.
3. Accessibility: Solutions should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities like colour blindness.
4. User Feedback: Insights gathered from user surveys and focus groups.

## Decision Outcome 
The final decision was to go with **Option C: Detailed Symbol Set** combined with the elements from **Option B: Color-Coded System**. 
Reasons for this decision include:
- Offers a balanced approach between clarity and detailed information.
- Enables users to understand the context of the image more comprehensively.
