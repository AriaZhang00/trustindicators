# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: March 3rd, 2024
- Decision Maker: All members

## Background
The risk management document created last semester includes comprehensive methods for identifying, assessing, and managing risks. This includes the classification of hazards, risk assessment criteria, and risk management methods, which have been effectively integrated into the project's framework. The document outlines detailed procedures and criteria for hazard severity, occurrence probability classifications, and risk evaluation metrics.

## Continued Decision Options
The risk management document and methodologies established in the previous semester will remain unchanged for the current semester because of the quality of outputs provided using this strategy, while further improving risk handling strategies.

## Rationale:
- Proven Effectiveness: The risk management strategies and tools implemented last semester have proven effective in identifying and mitigating risks throughout the project lifecycle.
- Consistency: Maintaining the existing risk management framework ensures consistency in project management practices and facilitates ongoing evaluation and control of project risks.
- Stability: There have been no significant changes in project scope, technology, or environmental factors that would necessitate a revision of the existing risk management approaches.

## Implications:
- Continuous Monitoring: The project team will continue to monitor and apply the established risk management practices to identify and address new and existing risks.
- Training and Awareness: Team members will continue to be trained on and reminded of the risk management procedures to ensure consistent application and adherence.
- Evaluation and Feedback: Regular evaluations will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the risk management strategies. Feedback will be actively solicited and reviewed to identify potential areas for future improvement.

## Action Items:
- Reaffirm the project team's commitment to the existing risk management procedures.
- Encourage team members to report new risks or changes in existing risks under the established protocols.
