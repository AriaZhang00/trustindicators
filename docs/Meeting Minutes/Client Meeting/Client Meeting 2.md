# **Client Meeting 1**

## **Date/Time:** 
20 March, 4:00 - 4:45 pm, N335 CSIT Building


## **Location:** 
CSIT Building


## **Attendees:** 

Lingxiu Cai, Vidhu Chaudhary, Tony Chen, Song Han, Yifang Meng, Zhaoyun Zhang, Prof. Sabrina Caldwell

## **Agenda:** 

1. Discuss project progress.
2. Discuss team member questions:
   2.1 Elaborate on the requirement of credibility signals - high-level or in-depth symbol set. 
   2.2 Elaborate on machine learning image analysis technique for different categories, if needs to be implemented or not and if yes, then in how much detail.

## **Discussion:**

1. Symbol sets should be intelligent symbols or a suite of symbols, 'whether it is what it says it to be', address misinterpretation, categories: camera photograph, scanned images, manipulated image and AI generated image.
2. Credibility indicators must take accountability for images.
3. Two major tasks:
   3.1 Credibility signals for individual categories
   3.2 Process for users to give image description and accountability statement.
4. How to determine which symbol should be applied? - Based on user statement if it is real or not.
5. Future work: Expand criteria for credibility to decide whether or not those symbols are used, and track the reputation of user who is accountable for giving credibility to images.
6. The website should operate on trust-basis from the user and not rely on machine learning algortihm to detect trustworthiness, because they are not reliable and computationally expensive.
7. Modify the website to include text statements explaining the trust associated to the website, and add sections to explain machine learning techniques used.
8. Clearly indicate the website doesn't take responsibility for real images, only trustworthy and declared images.
9. Use symbol subsets:
    9.1 Four general categories of symbols
    9.2 Atleast three sub-set categories for Metadata association, Authorship, ML Test passed or not.
    9.3 Trustable or not: Yes, No, Maybe.
